# pythonOS
It's an open source project made for people to create their own simulated operating systems, using python as its core, a project called pythonOS, modify it however you want and create whatever you want! graphical interface or more commands, etc.

## librarys
Most of the libraries used in this project are already from Python, but I created one specifically for my projects to make tkinter easier, the name of this library is 'pytkinterui' and you can download it using 'pip install pytkinterui'. This project started using this library in the versions that were released of the Simple Desktop for pythonOS, which was in versions 2.5 or 2.6 (I don't remember exactly). Libraries that are mandatory to use for graphical interface: pytkinterui (my library) and tkinter (already included in python by default)
